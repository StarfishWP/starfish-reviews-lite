Encourage your customers to leave 5-star reviews on Google, Facebook, Yellow Pages, and more. Starfish Reviews is the #1 reputation management plugin for WordPress!

== Description ==

_Starfish Reviews Lite_ enables reputation management campaigns on your WordPress website. Encourage positive, 5-star ratings and reviews while capturing negative reviews for internal improvement. Send the Starfish URL to your customers, users, followers, audience, etc and ask for feedback. The Starfish Reviews "funnel" will ask users how they feel about your site. If they like it, they'll be sent to whatever URL you set in the settings. This should be a link to the reviews section of wherever you want to get 5-star reviews. It could be your Google My Business listing, Facebook Page, Yelp, or even a podcast on iTunes, digital product on an online marketplace, or book on Amazon.

If people are not so happy with your product, service, media, etc, they'll be aske to provide feedback directly to you. This helps offset people's natural tendancy to only post reviews when they're upset. You'll still learn what you can do to improve, but it won't be published permanently, for the whole world to see.
